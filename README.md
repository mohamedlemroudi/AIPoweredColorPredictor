# 🤖 AI Neural Networks in Action: Smart Color Picker 🌈

I just built an interesting project using a simple neural network with **Brain.js**! This project demonstrates how a neural network can predict the optimal text color (either white or black) based on the background color selected by the user. 🧠

The neural network is trained with different color combinations, and it automatically adjusts the text color to provide the best contrast for readability. This kind of AI can greatly enhance the user experience by dynamically adjusting visual elements based on input data. ⚙️

It’s a fun and practical example of how **AI** can improve web design and accessibility. 🖥️

Feel free to check out the code and play with the color picker! What other practical uses of AI in web development can you think of? 🔍
